# System Research

> In general, finding a good problem is important for system research. 

Unfortunately, more often than not, I struggle to identify such a problem. In [this repository](https://github.com/PsiACE/system-research), I aim to share some materials that I have found particularly beneficial throughout my brief journey.

## General

- Keshav, S. (2007). **How to read a paper**. ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, 37(3), 83-84. https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1273445.1273458

  > The "three-pass" approach is described in just two pages.

- Ousterhout, J. (2018). **Always measure one level deeper**. Communications of the ACM, 61(7), 74-83. https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3213770

  > The only way to become expert is through trial and error. This article describes how to conduct performance measurement well.
